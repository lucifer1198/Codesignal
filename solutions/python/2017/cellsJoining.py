"""
You are writing a spreadsheet application for an ancient operating system.
The system runs on a computer so old that it can only display ASCII graphics.
Currently you are stuck with implementing the cells joining algorithm.

You are given a table in ASCII graphics, where the following characters are used for borders: +, -, |.
The rows can have different heights and the columns can have different widths.
Each cell has an area greater than 1 (excluding the borders) and can contain any ASCII characters excluding +, - and |.

The algorithm you want to implement should merge the cells within a given rectangular part of the table
into a single cell by removing the borders between them (i.e. replace them with space characters (' ')
and replace redundant +s with correct border symbols). The cells to join are represented by the coordinates
of the cells at the extreme bottom-left and top-right of the area.

Example

table = ["+----+--+-----+----+",
         "|abcd|56|!@#$%|qwer|",
         "|1234|78|^&=()|tyui|",
         "+----+--+-----+----+",
         "|zxcv|90|77777|stop|",
         "+----+--+-----+----+",
         "|asdf|~~|ghjkl|100$|",
         "+----+--+-----+----+"]
and coords = [[2, 0], [1, 1]], the output should be

cellsJoining(table, coords) = ["+----+--+-----+----+",
                               "|abcd|56|!@#$%|qwer|",
                               "|1234|78|^&=()|tyui|",
                               "+----+--+-----+----+",
                               "|zxcv 90|77777|stop|",
                               "|       +-----+----+",
                               "|asdf ~~|ghjkl|100$|",
                               "+-------+-----+----+"]
