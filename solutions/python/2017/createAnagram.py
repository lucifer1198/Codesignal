"""
You are given two strings s and t of the same length, consisting of uppercase English letters. 
Your task is to find the minimum number of "replacement operations" needed to get some anagram of the string t from the string s. 
A replacement operation is performed by picking exactly one character from the string s and replacing it by some other character.

–ê string x is an anagram of a string y if one can get y by rearranging the letters of x.
For example, the strings "MITE" and "TIME" are anagrams, so are "BABA" and "AABB", but "ABBAC" and "CAABA" are not.

Example

For s = "AABAA" and t = "BBAAA", the output should be
createAnagram(s, t) = 1;
For s = "OVGHK" and t = "RPGUC", the output should be
createAnagram(s, t) = 4.

def createAnagram(s, t):

    cnt1 = [0] * 26
    cnt2 = [0] * 26
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cnt1[ord(s[i]) - ord('A')] += 1
        cnt2[ord(t[i]) - ord('A')] += 1

    ans = 0
    for i in range(26):
        ans += abs(cnt1[i] - cnt2[i])

    return ans/2
